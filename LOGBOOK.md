# Project journey

## 09/08/2025

- Initial commit of the project.
- Removed all unnecesary files and directories generated by Loco. It is for now a very small service, thus I don't want to waste time on testing it. I prefer to focus on the core functionality on a new language for me.
- Removed the generated frontend for the CSR (Client-Side Rendering). I prefer to use vite + react rather than rsbuild. 
- Removed data, fixtures and mailer directories. I don't understand their use in this project. If i'll to implement a mailer, i'll re-write it to better understand how it works.
- Created this LOGBOOK :)
