# Project journey

## 09/08/2025

- Initial commit of the project.
- Removed all unnecesary files and directories generated by Loco. It is for now a very small service, thus I don't want to waste time on testing it. I prefer to focus on the core functionality on a new language for me.
- Removed the generated frontend for the CSR (Client-Side Rendering). I prefer to use vite + react rather than rsbuild. 
- Removed data, fixtures and mailer directories. I don't understand their use in this project. If i'll to implement a mailer, i'll re-write it to better understand how it works.
- Created this LOGBOOK :)

- Implemented my own error type in Rust for better error handling. Well understood how enums, strucs and traits are working together in Rust.
- Implemented my API client with a TanStack Query wrapper for my endpoints. This has been done with generics helpers to avoid code duplication.

- Added custom colors to the Tailwind CSS configuration.
- Implemented the login and register forms with validation using Zod and React Hook Form.
- Implemented the login and register modals with a custom dialog component using AI.

## 20/08/2025

- Introduce TanStack Router for the frontend router. A new tool that I am discovering for this project.
- Add my backend custom error typing to the frontend API client.
