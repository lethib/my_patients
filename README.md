## 📖 About

My Patients is a full-stack web application designed to help healthcare practitioners manage their patient records securely. Built with a focus on data privacy and security, it provides encrypted storage for sensitive patient information including social security numbers, along with automated invoice generation and delivery capabilities.

Key capabilities include comprehensive patient management, multi-office support, professional PDF invoice generation, and automated email delivery through background job processing.

This is a personal project built to explore modern web technologies including Rust backend development, secure cryptographic practices, and asynchronous background job processing.

## 🚢 Deployment

### Docker Build

The project includes an optimized multi-stage Dockerfile:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t my-patients .

# Run the container
docker run -p 5150:5150 --env-file .env my-patients
```

The Dockerfile uses:
- **cargo-chef** for faster Rust dependency caching
- **Bun** for fast frontend builds
- **Distroless** base image for minimal attack surface
- **Multi-stage builds** for optimal layer caching

## Building the Docker Image

Using the `dockerfile` file, you can build your Docker container image.

From the `oven/bun` image, build the frontend. **→ Apple users:** disable the _Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon_ from the Docker Desktop settings. We will build a `linux/amd64` image and its seems that [tailwind has issues with Apple Rosetta to build our CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18315#issuecomment-2984442515).

From the `rust` image, build the backend.
Then copy all the files from the frontend and backend builds into a new `distroless/cc-debian12` image.

⚠️ **Backend configuration**:

- `localhost` won't work for the host in production as you will access the service from outside the container (with a ping on the domain name that will point to the container). Thus the host must be `0.0.0.0`.
- For the CORS configuration, you can set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to `*` or to your Google Cloud Run domain (as it is Client Side Rendering).

⚠️ **Backend build**:

- When running a simple `cargo run --release`, the binary is built for the host architecture. If you want to build it for a specific target, you can use `cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (or any other target). Google Cloud Run uses `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` as the target architecture, so you should build your binary for that target.
- The docker image architecture must be a `linux/amd64` image. When running a simple `docker build . -t test`, it will build the image for the host architecture. If you want to build it for a specific target, you can use `docker build . -t test --platform linux/amd64` (or any other target).

## Deploying on Google Cloud Run

**Prerequisites**: your docker image must be pulled on a public or private registry accessible by Google Cloud Run. For instance, you can use Docker Hub (just push your built image to your Docker Hub account).

To deploy your application on Google Cloud Run, visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/run) and follow these steps:

- Create a global project if you don't have one.
- Enable the Cloud Run API.
- Visit the Cloud Run page and click on "Deploy a container".

**Service Configuration**:

- **Container image URL**: the URL of your Docker image (e.g., `your-id/your-image-name`).
- **Service name**: the name of your service (e.g., `my-app`).
- **Region**: select the region where you want to deploy your service (e.g., `europe-west9`).
- **Authentication**: If you want to use JWT authentication, you can allow unauthenticated invocations.
- **Billing**: First option, serverless, is the best option for small applications.

Then proceed to the container configuration.

**Container Configuration**:

- **Container port**: set the Google Cloud Run default port (8080). **⚠️ The `server.port` value must be read from the PORT Google Cloud Run env variable**. Otherwise, you app would not be able to restart properly after a cold start. To do that change the hardcoded from to `{{ get_env(name="PORT", default="5150") }}`.
- **Environment variables**: you can set environment variables for your application (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ENVIRONMENT` etc.).
- **Health checks**: you can enable health checks to ensure your service is running correctly. In our case, select HTTP and the path to your health check endpoint. Don't forget to **add a small delay** because your application might take some time to start up (e.g., 10 seconds).

Then proceed to the last steps.

- **Revision scaling**: reduce the number of instances to 3 (can be changed later to upgrade)
